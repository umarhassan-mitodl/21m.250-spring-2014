Concert of Beethoven Sonatas
----------------------------

### **Susanna Ogata, violin**

### **Ian Watson, fortepiano**

This concert took place as part of the [Handel & Haydn partnership with MIT](http://handelandhaydn.org/education/for-college-students/mit-partnership/) on February 26, 2014 in Killian Hall.

Violinist Susanna Ogata and English keyboardist Ian Watson are period-instrument specialists. Here, they demonstrate sonatas of Beethoven from a time of crisis and renewal (1801–1803) on fortepiano, a historic instrument that preceded the modern piano and sounds quite different, and period violin.
